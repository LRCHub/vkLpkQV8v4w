I say hey, rich man
What you talking about?
I am a lover
With the scream and shout
You got no heart, friend
That's what I'm all about
You got no soul, man
To go and work it out out, hey

You got the power
To make a sound now
You get so sour
On how your cards worked out
I'll take it back now
If you put up the
?
With your?

I say hey, rich man
Now what's it to ya?
I am a lover
And I will school ya
I got some heart, friend
And that's what I am about
You got no soul, man
So won't you work it out out, hey hey?

I just say get on
Just say get on that beat already
Shoot, that's gonna burn up in a fire anyway
