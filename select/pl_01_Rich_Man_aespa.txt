"Mom, I already have everything"

날 밀어 넣고
멋대로 굴 때
내 것을 탐내
See, my name is
Where my name is

That's me 나는 Reckless
굳은 멘탈 그것쯤 웃네
내가 날 이끌어 가

별거 아냐
Exit is my next step
딴 생각 말고

Make it better
on my own — my tag

I'm like a Diamond ring
Already got my thing
Cannot put a price on it
This is the real deal
